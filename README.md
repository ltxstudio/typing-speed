# Typing Test Project

A fun and interactive typing test to measure your typing speed and accuracy. Track your progress, challenge yourself to improve your typing skills, and compare your performance with others. This project is built with React and Vite, with features like real-time typing speed calculation, error tracking, and more.

## Features

- **Typing Speed**: Measure your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Track typing errors and improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on your typing speed and errors as you type.
- **High Score**: Save your highest typing speed for future challenges.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume the test without losing progress.
- **Info Section**: Learn how to use the app and its features.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool for front-end development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ltxstudio/typing-speed
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd typing-speed
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

- Once the app loads, a random text will appear. Start typing the text in the input box.
- The app will track your typing speed (in WPM) and errors.
- Once you complete the text, the app will show your results: typing speed, errors, and time taken.
- You can pause and resume the test anytime.
- To restart the test, click the "Restart Test" button.

## How It Works

1. **Start Typing**: When you start typing, the timer begins, and the app tracks the text you type.
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Each character you type will be highlighted in green for correct and red for incorrect characters.
3. **Calculation**: The typing speed (WPM) and error count are calculated in real time.
4. **Results**: Once you complete the text, your results (WPM, errors, and time taken) will be displayed. If your WPM exceeds the high score, it will be updated and saved locally.
